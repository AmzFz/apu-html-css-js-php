---------------

SQL to create a table for the `Book` class based on the fields provided:

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    tags TEXT,
    book_image VARCHAR(255),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    book_details TEXT
);
```

**Notes**:
1. `book_id` is set as the primary key and will auto-increment.
2. `title` and `category` are required fields (`NOT NULL`).
3. `tags` and `book_details` are of type `TEXT` to allow for longer strings, but you can adjust the type and length based on your needs.
4. `book_image` is assumed to store the path or URL of the image, so it's a `VARCHAR`. Adjust the length as needed.
5. `price` is a decimal type with a precision of 10 digits in total and 2 digits after the decimal point. Adjust as per your requirements.
